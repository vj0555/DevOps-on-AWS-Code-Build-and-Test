# DevOps-on-AWS-Code-Build-and-Test
Exercise: Setting Up Your Development Environment In a production environment, you would normally create a customer managed policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Customer managed policies provide more precise control over your policies than policies that AWS manages. This policy would then have permissions that are specific to the AWS resources you need. You would also attach this policy to a new user and log in to the AWS Management Console with that new user. However, because you are working in an exercise environment, those steps were omitted.  In this exercise, you will start by creating an AWS Cloud9 environment for your development environment. In this environment, you will download and extract the source code that you will use in this course. You will deploy the application’s backend infrastructure by using the AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI). You will use AWS SAM to create all the resources that host the backend of the application: an Amazon API Gateway gateway, AWS Lambda functions, an Amazon DynamoDB table, and an AWS Step Functions state machine. You will also deploy the application frontend: a React web application that’s hosted on an S3 bucket, which acts as the web server. After the application is up and running, you will put the application under source control by using AWS CodeCommit.
